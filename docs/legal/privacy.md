# Privacy policy

> **Last updated:** Apr 10, 2025

The privacy of your data is very important to us. In this policy, we go over what information we collect, how we store your data, third parties we utilize, and our GDPR compliance.

**We have never and will never sell your data.**

## What we collect

The information that we store include:

- Your email, name, and profile picture
- Any OAuth connections linked to your account
- The data in the lists that you create
- The lists that you have liked

## Cookies

Cookies are small files of information that a web server generates and sends to a web browser. Web browsers store the cookies they receive for a predetermined period of time, or for the length of a user's session on a website. They attach the relevant cookies to any future requests the user makes of the web server. You can [learn more about cookies here](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-are-cookies/).

We only store functional cookies on your device, when you log in to our services. These cookies include session tokens, CSRF tokens, etc. which make the login / logout experience possible.

## Third party authentication

When you sign in on Moddermore via OAuth, we collect a very minimal amount of information from the third party you used to log in, mostly comprising of your email. We link your accounts with the same email together if possible.

Your usage of the third party falls under their privacy policy and we are not liable for their usage of your personal data.

## Data security

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted from our servers to your browser.

On our database provider, [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas), all network traffic is encrypted using Transport layer Security (TLS), with flexibility to configure the minimum TLS protocol version. Encryption for data at rest is automated using encrypted storage volumes.

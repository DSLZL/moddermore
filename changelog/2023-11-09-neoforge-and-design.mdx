We are delighted to announce that **Moddermore now supports [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net/)** alongside Quilt, Fabric, and Forge! This includes support for MultiMC instances, Modrinth modpack exports, and packwiz output as well.

Also, you might notice quite a few changes in the **design** of Moddermore.

- We have adopted a new brand font, Satoshi, that should help Moddermore stand out and improve the legibility of its design.
- The dashboard layout is now more consistent between tabs and more balanced in layout.
- The visibility selector has been redesigned to give more information about what each option does.
- Your profile picture is now displayed in the navigation bar and links to the dashboard.
- Privileged actions on lists (e.g. editing or changing settings) now have their own distinguishing color and are on a separate row.

In addition, we have made a significant improvement in the behavior of unlisted and private lists by **preventing search engines from crawling them**. This ensures that none of your unlisted or private lists unexpected show up in online searches.
